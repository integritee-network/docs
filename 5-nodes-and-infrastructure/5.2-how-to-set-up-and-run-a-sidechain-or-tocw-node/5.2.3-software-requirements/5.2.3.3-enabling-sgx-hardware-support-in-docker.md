# 5.2.3.3 Enabling SGX Hardware support in Docker

If you are on a platform that supports SGX, you can enable HW support by:

* Enabling SGX support as described above
* Installing the [Intel SGX Driver](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver) and the [Intel SGX SDK](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx) and make sure that `/dev/isgx` appears.
* Start the docker with SGX device support:

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/root/work --device /dev/isgx integritee/integritee-dev:0.1.12 /bin/bash
```

* Start the aesm service inside the docker:

```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/sgx-aesm-service/aesm/ /opt/intel/sgx-aesm-service/aesm/aesm_service &
```

If you run the Hardware Mode on a platform that does not support SGX or has it misconfigured, you get the following error from the process:

```
*** Start the enclave

```
