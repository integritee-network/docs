# 5.2.3.2 Docker

We also provide docker images with all the tools installed, you can find them on [<img src="https://hub.docker.com/favicon.ico" alt="" data-size="line">Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/integritee/integritee-dev/tags). These are Ubuntu 22.04 images with the above tools installed.

Execute the following command to get the docker image.

```
docker pull integritee/integritee-dev:0.2.1
```

The following command enters the docker image and starts a bash session inside the container, mounting the current directory `pwd` into `/home/ubuntu/work` inside the docker image. Hence, we recommend running the command either in the SDKâ€™s root directory or in its parent directory if you also want to mount other projects inside the docker container.

```
docker run --name integritee-dev -it -v $(pwd):/home/ubuntu/work -e MYUID=$(id -u) -e MYGUID=$(id -g) integritee/integritee-dev:0.2.1 /bin/bash
```

Inside the docker

```
cd work
make 
exit
```



It is useful to only stop the container instead of tearing it down in between sessions if you are developing because the cargo build cache is preserved. To restart and re-enter the docker container created above, you can execute the following command.

```
docker start -a -i integritee-dev
```
