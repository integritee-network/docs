# 5.2.3.2 Docker

We also provide docker images with all the tools installed, you can find them on [<img src="https://hub.docker.com/favicon.ico" alt="" data-size="line">Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/integritee/integritee-dev/tags). These are Ubuntu 20.04 images with the above tools installed.

Execute the following command to get the docker image.

```
docker pull integritee/integritee-dev:0.1.9
```

The following command enters the docker image and starts a bash session inside the container, mounting the current directory `pwd` into `/root/work` inside the docker image. Hence, we recommend running the command either in the SDK’s root directory or in its parent directory if you also want to mount other projects inside the docker container.

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/root/work integritee/integritee-dev:0.1.9 /bin/bash
```

It is useful to only stop the container instead of tearing it down in between sessions if you are developing because the cargo build cache is preserved. To restart and re-enter the docker container created above, you can execute the following command.

```
docker start <Docker-ID> && docker exec -it <Docker-ID> bash
```

You can lock up the Docker-ID of stopped containers with `docker ps -a`.
