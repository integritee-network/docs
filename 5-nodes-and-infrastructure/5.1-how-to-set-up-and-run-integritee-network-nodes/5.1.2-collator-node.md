# 5.1.2 Collator Node

### **Preliminaries**

Integriteeâ€™s Aura Consensus works by registering a fixed set of authorities that will produce blocks in a round-robin fashion. To be part of the authority set, you can get in touch with the Integritee core team. If we decide that you have an honest commitment to the network, we will update the authority set to include your key through the governance process.

**Aura Key Creation:** Aura keys are `sr2559` keys and can be created with [Subkey](https://core.tetcoin.org/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey).

&#x20;

### **Registration Process**

Registering a new collator is currently a privileged low-level function call; `system.set_storage`. Therefore, registration needs to pass governance. The low-level call will be replaced with the introduction of the `pallet-collator-selection`. However, this will not change that updating the collator set needs governance. This privileged function call will be prepared by Integritee. All you need to do is send us your public key.

&#x20;

### **Run The node**

See the above chapter on how to run a full-node. There is only one difference. The parachain CLI (the part before the `--`) needs the `--collator` flag.

### **Collator Configuration**

The Aura key needs to be injected into the node's keystore. The node will start to collate if it finds its key in the registered authority set. The key injection can be done with the RPC `aura_insertKey` or with Subkey.

```bash
# RPC 
curl http://localhost:9936 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"author_insertKey", "params": [ "aura", <suri>, "<pubKey>" ] }' 

# Subkey 
subkey insert --suri <suri> --base-path /integritee/data --key-type aura
```
