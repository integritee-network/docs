Securitee, our subsidiary, offers the required secure infrastructure to run sidechain validator nodes and off-chain workers (incl. workers for oracles built with Integritee’s oracle framework Teeracle). Clients can choose from different server types and subscription plans with various parameter configuration options to meet the specific needs of any use case. Available product plans are designed to accomodate any use case built with Integritee’s SDK, so that users of Integritee’s SDK do not have to worry about choosing the right infrastructure. Deployment on Securitee is done in a few simple steps:
