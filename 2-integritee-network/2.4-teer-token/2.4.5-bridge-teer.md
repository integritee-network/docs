# 2.4.5 How to bridge TEER

The TEER token is available on multiple chains which are connected through [trustless bridges](https://polkadot.com/get-started/bridges/). The following diagram shows an overview of all chains and relevant exchanges:

Most likely, your TEER tokens reside on our Kusama Parachain where we issued them as crowdloan rewards and where centralized exchanges currently withdraw and deposit from.

## Bridging TEER between integritee-kusama and integritee-polkadot Parachains

TEER is the native token of both our parachains, integritee-kusama and integritee-polkadot. TEER can be bridged trustlessly and fungibly between these networks. We have simplified this process with the porTEER pallet 

### Usage

*A convenient web-dApp is in the making and will be available very SOON*

Until then, the process is still quite simple:

1. on the source chain, call `porteer.portTokens`: [PJS IP extrinsic](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot.api.integritee.network#/extrinsics/decode/0x3806070010a5d4e800) 
2. wait 2-3 minutes, until you see the event `porteer.MintedPortedTokens` on [PJS IK](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.integritee.network#/explorer)

This will teleport your TEER. Effectively, the process will burn your selected amount of TEER tokens on the source chain and mint the same amount on the target chain. 

Please note: 
* bridging costs fees in TEER which will be charged on the source chain on top of the amount you choose to be bridged.
* The Integritee team simulates the process every 30min and monitors the bridges. However, we cannot guarantee that the bridge will always be available because it relies on external components like the asset hubs, bridge hubs and relayers which may change their fees and behavior over time and are out of our control. Our monitoring ensures that the bridge will be swiftly paused in case of any issues until we can resolve them.


## Bridging TEER between integritee-polkadot and Ethereum

TEER also exists as an [ERC-20 token on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/token/0x769916a66fdac0e3d57363129caac59386ea622b). The [Snowbridge](https://app.snowbridge.network/) is your go-to dApp to bridge TEER between Ethereum and asset-hub-polkadot.

### Usage

Assuming you already have TEER on AssetHub Polkadot and want to bridge them to Ethereum:
1. visit [Snowbridge dApp](https://app.snowbridge.network/)
2. from "Polkadot Asset Hub"
3. to "Ethereum"
4. from account: connect your Polkadot wallet holding TEER on Polkadot Asset Hub
5. to account: connect your Ethereum wallet which shall receive the bridged TEER
6. amount: enter the amount of TEER you want to bridge
7. select "Integritee TEER" as asset
8. click "Submit" and follow the instructions
