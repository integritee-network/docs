# 2.5.4 Democracy

### **Participate in Democracy**

The public Referenda Chamber is one of the three bodies alongside the Council and the Technical Committee governing the Integritee network. Public referenda can be proposed and voted by any token holder with a bond. Every voting period, one proposal with the most support (# of seconds) will be moved to the referenda table for public voting. Voters who are willing to lock up tokens for a greater duration of time can have their votes amplified. This is conceptually equivalent to Polkadot.

### **Propose a Referendum**

A referendum consists of some action that you want to propose. If voted in by token holders, then the action will be enacted on-chain automatically. You are required to bond some tokens to propose an action. Once a proposal is submitted, it cannot be cancelled.

A new proposal can be formed in the Polkadot-js/apps \[Democracy]\([<img src="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/favicon.ico" alt="" data-size="line">Polkadot/Substrate Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fintegritee-kusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/democracy) ) tab. The action, such as 'force transfer balance from account A to account B', is encoded in a preimage, and the hash of the action is called preimage hash.

Since the preimage can be quite large (hence costly to submit), you can submit a Proposal first which includes the preimage hash only, and submit the preimage (or have someone else submit it for you) later but before voting completes.

#### **Step 1: Submit a Proposal**

By clicking on the `Submit preimage` button, then fill in the action you want to propose, copy and note down the preimage hash `0xf7b547b996c77dd7ac16685dbf47bf34eb9c6643b8e94d7d2e16db400c0c556a`. Once you noted down the hash, you can now cancel the prompt.

Submit a proposal by clicking on the `Submit a proposal` button, and pasting in the preimage hash to submit it. Then the proposal will appear in the proposal table.

#### **Step 2: Submit the Preimage**

Before voting of your proposal completes, you will need to submit the actual preimage. Otherwise, it cannot be enacted on-chain. You can repeat the ‘Submit a preimage’ process as previously mentioned, and click the ‘Submit preimage’ button to send the transaction.\


### **Vote on a Referendum**

Once a proposal has been promoted to a referendum, it must collect sufficient votes to be enacted. Voting on a referendum requires bonding of tokens with a conviction of choice. High conviction means the tokens will be bonded and therefore locked for a longer time, but in turn we vote has more weight.

The active referenda are found in the \[Democracy]\([<img src="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/favicon.ico" alt="" data-size="line">Polkadot/Substrate Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fintegritee-kusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/democracy) ) tab of Polkadot-js/apps.
