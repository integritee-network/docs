# 2.1.1 A public registry of remote attestation

Remote attestation is the process of asking the TEE manufacturer to authenticate a TEE and provide the hash, i.e. the fingerprint, about its business logic. More in-depth details about remote attestation can be found here: 2.7.2. What is remote attestation?.

We store this remote attestation transparently on our decentralized network, which means that anyone can audit a TEE for its integrity. Thus, it is a public proof on a decentralized network that data is only processed in pre-agreed ways, fostering transparency and trust.

The attestation also contains the TEE’s public signing key; hence, users will always be certain that they are communicating with the correct TEE.
