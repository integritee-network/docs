# 1 Introduction

### Short Intro

Integritee is a highly scalable, privacy-enabling network in the Polkadot ecosystem with parachains on Polkadot and Kusama. We seek to become the leading Web3 privacy solution - a blockchain network for developers and relevant to enterprises to build (decentralized) applications that benefit from unrivaled speed, verifiable confidentiality/privacy, and interoperability. At scale.

Our solution combines the security and trust of Polkadot, the scalability of second-layer solutions, and the confidentiality of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) - a special-purpose hardware inside which computations run securely, confidentially, and verifiably. Our technology is relevant to both Web3 developers and enterprises who would like to benefit from verifiable privacy and public auditability.

For Web3 developers, we offer powerful tools to build strong decentralized solutions for multiple use cases: From decentralized gaming providers who require low latencies and scalability to compete with traditional gaming, to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) wanting to avoid front-running, and identity protocols seeking to keep sensitive information private, the scope is ample. Integritee also bridges the gap between Web3 and Web2 with a trusted oracle framework to ensure interoperability with real-world data.

Through our technology, we solve pressing challenges that blockchain solutions currently face, namely performance, privacy, scalability issues, and a lack of interoperability. While this enhanced blockchain value proposition is highly relevant to Web3 projects seeking to overcome these challenges, we truly believe that we can greatly increase blockchain adoption also for enterprise stakeholders by enabling totally new and improved use cases for decentralized applications.

Apart from our strong Web3 value proposition, enterprises can leverage our unique solution for verifiable privacy and public auditability. Data is processed and applications run in a secure TEE. The integrity and genuineness of the TEE and the hash of the binary it is executing are subsequently verified and a respective proof registered on our public ledger, making it transparent to any third party. This combination of verifiable privacy and public auditability provides a significant benefit, e.g., for institutions that want to prove data security and sovereignty to their customers or in case of data sharing collaborations between multiple parties.

### Overview

In the following chapters, we will offer insight into the fundamentals of the Integritee network, and its benefits for developers, companies, and users. We will also highlight and explain our main goals.

Further down, you will find Dev and DevOps-oriented content to guide those who wish to build on our platform.
