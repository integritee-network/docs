# 4.7 Performance Benchmarking

The goal of benchmarking is to find limits to the following measures:

* Throughput: How many transactions per second (tps) can we process on a sidechain for different blocktimes (300ms, 6s)?
* Number of concurrent connected clients
* Size of the state (and #Accounts)

In order to reproduce benchmarks, please follow our [benchmarking instructions](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/master/docker/README.md#run-the-benchmarks)

### Results

for `sdk-v0.10.0-polkadot-v0.9.27,` running on Intel(R) Xeon(R) E-2176G CPU @ 3.70GHz with 32 GB RAM

* With a **300ms blocktime** we can process **up to 1900 tps** and at least 38 tps at a state size of 4000 accounts
* With a 6s blocktime we can process up to 900 tps and at least 10 tps at a state size of 100’000 accounts (around 20MB)
* typical throughput is 500 tps
* **At least 250 clients** can connect to one validator concurrently and send at least on tx per block

With identified state handling improvements, we should be able to improve state size degradation by 6x:

* With a 300ms blocktime 38 tps at a state size of 24'000 accounts

#### **Sidechain Datasheet**

* down to 300ms block time
* 500 tps typical per sidechain, degrading above 5’000 accounts state size
* 250 wss concurrent client connections per validator
* overall sharded throughput of integritee network currently extrapolates to **50k tps** (improvements of polkadot protocol and our sidechain finality can potentially push this towards an estimated **1-4M tps**)
