# 4.8.3.2 Trusted Software Source

To generate an open source flash image, which is signed, is problematic. Because the one who is signing is a new root of trust. Therefore, in this concept this root is spread over a multiple participants to get to an open source like root of trust. The parties should be as independent as possible. The diagram below visualizes our approach. On the left side is the open source code visible for everyone. Everything that follows is constructed under the assumption that the parties have established secure communication channels. All parties (Web3, SCS, ...) collaborate in the Multi-Party-Computation (MPC) RSA generation. As a result, everyone receives the public key and a part of the private key. Therefore, they can only together generate a signature. This is used to build a binary that only can be signed by all parties together. They take the source code and build it deterministically. Afterwards, they sign their binary and exchange it with each other. Then, they check the binaries from the other parties, if they are the same, they combine the signatures to the final signature. This signature can be verified with the public key.
