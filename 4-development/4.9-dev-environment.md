# 4.9 Development environment
Everyone knows it: setting up a development environment is always a hassle, especially when it comes to SGX. So this 
section aims to help with this. Our developers do usually work with an SGX capable hardware itself, see
[5.2](../5-nodes-and-infrastructure/5.2-how-to-set-up-and-run-a-sidechain-or-tocw-node), or develop within a Docker 
container, or just build inside a Docker. The latter two are elaborated in this chapter.

## Develop inside a Docker container
The paradigm here is that the files are living on the host file system, but they are mounted into the Docker container,
and the build commands are executed from within the Docker container.

This is the Docker container we are using: [https://hub.docker.com/r/integritee/integritee-dev](https://hub.Docker.com/r/integritee/integritee-dev).

In general, we have two repositories that are relevant for running a complete test-setup:
- [integritee-worker](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker)
- [integrite-node](https://github.com/integritee-network/integritee-node).

The launch scripts assume that the two repositories reside in the same directory.

Steps to get a running setup:

1. Mount the current directory containing the integritee-worker and integritee node into the Docker container and start a bash session inside: 
```
docker run -it --mount "type=bind,src=$(pwd),dst=/opt/shared" --workdir /opt/shared  -p integritee/integritee-dev:0.1.10 /bin/bash
```
2. Now you have access to the shell in the Docker container. So you can start the builds.
```shell
# First build the node

# See documentation for the build flags in: https://github.com/integritee-network/integritee-node#build-and-run
cd integritee-node
cargo build release --features "skip-extrinsic-filtering skip-ias-check"

# Go to parent-directory.
cd ../

# Build the worker: in this example we compile it in the offchain worker mode.
cd integritee-worker

# Build the offchain-worker in software mode if you don't have the SGX hardware set up.
# How to enable hardware mode in Docker can be found here in chapter 5.2.3.3.
SGX_MODE=SW WORKER_MODE=offchain-worker make

# The output file will be in the ./bin folder.

# Then you can spawn two workers and the integritee-node with the launch script.
./local-setup/launch.py ./local-setup/simple-config.json

# Enter the same Docker container with a bash session.
docker exec -it [container-id] bash
 
# Have a look at the logs with the handy tmux scripts (the logs are only populated if the launch.py was used).
cd integritee-worker/local-setup
./tmux_logger.sh
 
# The demo scripts can be executed in yet another terminal session, when you enter the Docker container.
docker exec -it [container-id] bash

# This script also shows what kind of commands you can execute with the CLI.
cd integritee-worker/cli
./demo_shielding_unshielding.sh

# Check available commands of the CLI.
cd ./bin
./integritee-cli --help

# For trusted commands to talk with an enclave.
./integritee-cli trusted --help

```

**Hints**
* The rust build cache is preserved so when you continue to develop you can just type `docker start [container-id]` and 
do `docker exec -it [container-id] bash` to re-enter the build environment as you left it!
