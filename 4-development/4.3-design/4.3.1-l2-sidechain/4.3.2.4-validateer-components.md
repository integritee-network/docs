# 4.3.1.4 Validateer components

Let's have a brief, high-level look at the main components inside a validateer for the sidechain block production.

The validateer component is split into two areas, untrusted and trusted. The trusted area is everything inside the enclave (TEE) and what is exclusively accessible by the enclave, such as the state. Both the trusted and untrusted areas have an RPC interface. The trusted RPC interface is used to send direct invocation calls, which are then added to the trusted operation pool. The trusted RPC interface is also used when we broadcast sidechain blocks. This then internally fills the sidechain block import queue.

The slot worker component runs for every slot, imports sidechain blocks, executes trusted operations, and updates the state, as described in the chapter above. On the untrusted side we have a store for sidechain blocks, where we cache the last 100 blocks. This can be done on the untrusted side because sidechain blocks are signed, and any tampering could be noticed by verifying the signature. This store allows us to provide an RPC interface from which sidechain blocks can be fetched. This is relevant for the on-boarding process of new validateers which will be explained later.
