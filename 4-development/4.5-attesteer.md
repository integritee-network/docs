# 4.5 Attesteer

The Integritee Attesteer is an API service to interface with the decentralized DCAP attestation on the Integritee Network.

**Advantages of using the Attesteer:**

* No need for a license with Intel
* Your end-users can verify remote attestation themselves and authenticate your enclave (client side) thanks to our public Integritee Network.
* Unstoppable: remote attestation on Integritee Network doesn't rely on the consent or availability of Intel or data centers hosting your SGX machine.
* Hassle-free remote attestation

## Three Ways to do Remote Attestation on Integritee Network

1. If you build your enclave based on our SDK, you don't need the Attesteer because your enclave will be sovereign; it can interact with the Integritee Network to do DCAP attestation independently.
2. If you build your enclave with [Gramine](https://gramineproject.io/) and deploy it with [securitee.tech](http://securitee.tech), you need not worry. The attestation on the Integritee Network will happen automatically, managed by [marblerun](https://www.edgeless.systems/products/marblerun/) as a part of the Securitee service.
3. In case you build a custom enclave yourself from scratch, the Attesteer JSON-RPC is your easy-to-use gateway API to the Integritee Network. See instructions below on how to do that.

## How to use the Attesteer

The Attesteer acts as a proxy for remote attestation for enclaves that are not sovereign (i.e. can't send RA transaction to the Integritee Network by themselves). For Intel SGX enclaves, this is really just a proxy forwarding service, which would not even need to run in an enclave.

### Submitting your Attestation Quote

For enclaves not built with our SDK and not managed by MarbleRun on [securitee.tech](http://securitee.tech), the Attesteer exposes an API, which will forward attestation quotes for you.

The API endpoints are (json-rpc over secure websocket):

* Mainnet: [attesteer-kusama.integritee.network:2000](wss://attesteer-kusama.integritee.network:2000)
* Testnet on Rococo: [attesteer-rococo.integritee.network:3000](wss://attesteer-rococo.integritee.network:3000)

We will show here step by step how this works with Intel's sample enclave.

In the following, we assume that you 
1. have the Intel SGX SDK installed 
2. have a working build environment
3. are working on a real Intel SGX enabled machine with correct BIOS settings and recent security patches applied

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
git clone git@github.com:intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives.git
cd SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives
git checkout DCAP_1.16
cd SampleCode/QuoteGenerationSample
make
./app
xxd -plain quote.dat | tr -d '[[:blank:][:space:]]' > quote_single_line.hex
```
{% endcode %}

From the output `quote_single_line.hex`, you can build your JSON-RPC request like this:

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```json
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "method":"attesteer_forwardDcapQuote",
    "params":[
        "<hex encoded quote from quote_single_line.hex>",
        "myenclave.com"
    ],
    "id": 1
}
```
{% endcode %}

You can see in the above snippet that there is an optional parameter for the public URL `myenclave.com` of your enclave. In the next section, we will explain why this is important for public auditability.

For test purposes, you could send this request with _websocat_ (replace the JSON request with your own. The one below just fetches the available methods):

_You will need to_ [_setup a Rust build environment_](https://rustup.rs/) _for this_

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
cargo install websocat
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"rpc_methods","params":[],"id":1}' > request.json 
echo "$(cat request.json | tr -d '\n' )" | websocat wss://attesteer-rococo.integritee.network:3000 --insecure
```
{% endcode %}

If the request is correct, the Attesteer will send the quote to the Integritee Network for verification and your enclave will be recorded in the teerex registry, where everyone can look up your enclave's attributes:

* the MRENCLAVE
* the signing key (if you provide it as SGX\_REPORT\_DATA when you build your enclave)
* the URL where your enclave is reachable (optional)

The full information in the teerex registry is:

* the MRENCLAVE in the case of Intel SGX `fingerprint: 0x8a2faa318ac37bd3895979188d86a1514bd66ce024a169f20f92640ec4f158f9`
* the attesteer's account: `registrar: 2JqMzr1BanEZQ4xG3mGCWcmXdoiEPWMkiuf2XqVn1qmuQy4w`
* the public key for users to do enclave authentication with `
signer: {
  Opaque: 0x3792475ef5e50be41e68a2b48c85d92c4245e97f17b21b6d2d9000ee8c4bfc5a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
}`
* timestamp of quote verification: `timestamp: 1,691,754,696,185`
* the public url of your enclave: `url: my.enclave.com`
* SGX-specific stuff
   * the MRSIGNER who signed the enclave build (vendor): `mrSigner: 0x43361affedeb75affee9baec7e054a5e14883213e5a121b67d74a0e12e9d2b7a`
   * SGX_MODE: `buildMode: Production`
   * Attestation SGX_STATUS: `status: Ok`

#### Dashboard

For convenience, we provide a dashboard where you can browse the contents of the teerex registry and verify your enclave has been attested successfully.

* [Enclave Registry Dashboard for **mainnet**](https://enclaves.integritee.network)
  * please bear in mind that mainnet will reject enclaves built in SGX debug mode
* [Enclave Registry Dashboard for **testnet** on Rococo](https://enclaves.integritee.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo.api.integritee.network)

### Enclave Authentication

The Integritee Network's promise of public auditability is only meaningful if end users can look up your enclave on the Integritee Network and find the enclave's authentication public key together with the URL to initiate communication with your enclave.

In the best case, the enclave's key should be generated within the enclave itself as an initialization step and then provided as SGX\_REPORT\_DATA when generating the quote. In the sample code we used above, you could introduce the public key on [this line](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/blob/e7604e02331b3377f3766ed3653250e03af72d45/SampleCode/QuoteGenerationSample/Enclave/Enclave.cpp#L44).

We make no assumptions whatsoever about the cryptography you use for this, nor the protocol you use to talk to your enclave. It is up to you to communicate to your users how they should authenticate your enclaves.
