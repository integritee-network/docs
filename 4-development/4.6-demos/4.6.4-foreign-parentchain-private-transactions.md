# 4.6.3 Foreign Parachain Private Transactions Sidechain

The previous demos used a single L1 blockchain, the Integritee Network. But what if you'd like to deploy a sidechain on the Polkadot AssetHub and provide private transactions of DOT and all other assets? We have [demonstrated such a system in this video](https://youtu.be/BNYEfQ8kF2o?si=lHfDn4oEk9Lj7TwF) with high level explanations and a UI mock.  This tutorial lets you reproduce that demo.

We will
1. launch a rococo-local relaychain with two parachains using zombienet:
   2. parachain 1 is Integritee Network with TEER as its native token where our SCV registers their enclaves and finalize sidechain blocks
   3. parachain 2 is any substrate based chain using frame with the balances pallet. Let this be the AssetHub with DOT as its native token. 
4. launch a sidechain with a single validateer (SCV)
5. shield DOT from AssetHub to Sidechain
6. transfer DOT privately on sidechain
7. unshield DOT back to AssetHub

## Setup

We will launch the chains on a linux host and run the sidechain in a docker environment emulating Intel SGX so that you don't need any specific hardware to follow this tutorial.

Please follow our explanations to
1. [Set up dev environment](../4.9-dev-environment.md#run-worker-and-clients-in-docker-but-chains-and-on-host)
2. Install [Zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/latest) on host 
3. build polkadot and parachains binaries. check our [zombienet spec](https://github.com/integritee-network/parachain/blob/master/zombienet/rococo-local-with-privacy-sidechain-demo-setup.toml) to see where each binary is expected to be located

## Launch Relay- and Parachains

On the host, run 
```
zombienet-linux-x64 spawn --provider native zombienet/rococo-local-with-privacy-sidechain-demo-setup.toml
```

You can now use js/apps or other frontends to watch chain activity for 
* Integritee Network at port 9944
* AssetHub at port 9954

## Launch sidechain

Inside docker, open two consoles with `tmux -u` and launch one sidechain validateer:
```
./integritee-service -c -u ws://172.17.0.1 --target-a-parentchain-rpc-url ws://172.17.0.1 --target-a-parentchain-rpc-port 9954 run --skip-ra --dev
```
wait until you see a ProxyAdded event on Integritee Network

should you wish to add a second validateer to make it more realistic, add another console and run

```
./integritee-service -u ws://172.17.0.1 --target-a-parentchain-rpc-url ws://172.17.0.1 --target-a-parentchain-rpc-port 9954 -r 3444 -P 2100 -h 2110 -w 2101 -i 8788 -c -d /tmp/worker2 run --skip-ra --dev
```

## Perform Private Transactions on the Sidechain
in the second terminal we will perform wallet actions:

for readability, let's define a few aliases and prepare accounts

```
alias integritee="../target/release/integritee-cli -u ws://172.17.0.1"
alias assethub="../target/release/integritee-cli -u ws://172.17.0.1 -p 9954"
read MRENCLAVE <<< $(integritee list-workers | awk '/  MRENCLAVE: / { print $2; exit }')
alias incognitee="../target/release/integritee-cli -u ws://172.17.0.1 trusted --mrenclave $MRENCLAVE"
assethub transfer //Alice //Laura 100000000000000
incognitee get-shard-vault
read VAULT <<< $(incognitee get-shard-vault)
```

then you can reproduce our entire demo with the following commands:

```
assethub balance //Laura
incognitee balance //Laura
incognitee get-shard-vault
assethub transfer //Laura $VAULT 50000000000000
assethub balance //Laura
incognitee balance //Laura 

incognitee balance //Julian
incognitee --direct transfer //Laura //Julian 10000000000000
incognitee balance //Laura
incognitee balance //Julian

assethub balance //Edward
incognitee --direct unshield-funds //Julian //Edward 9000000000000
assethub balance //Edward
incognitee balance //Julian
```

## More Logs Please

You can play with log levels to get more insight into what's happening. For worker and cli, use 

```
RUST_LOG=info,substrate_api_client=warn,ws=warn,mio=warn,ac_node_api=warn,sp_io=warn,tungstenite=warn
```

of course, you can go down to `debug` or even `trace` as default log level. For production deployments, logs from the enclave will be disabled to avoid data leaks.
