# 4.4.3 TEEracle -  Oracle Framework
The TEEracle SDK facilitates submission of trustworthy oracle data into the Integritee parachain. It retrieves website or API data and serves source-authenticated data to the parachain.

### **Generic TEEracle**
Coming soon !

### **Exchange rate oracle**
We already have a running TEEracle connected to the Integritee parachain that supplies the TEER-USD exchange rate. This exchange rate will be used to offer stable USD fees.  
The exchange rate values are from two different sources, https://www.coingecko.com/ and https://coinmarketcap.com/api/, and updated once per day.

### **How to use the SDK**
1. Experiment with the template, running the [teeracle demo](../4.6-demos/4.6.3-demo-demo.md)â€‹
2. Fork the worker repository `https://github.com/integritee-network/worker.git` from the SDK release branch (TODO release)
3. Build the worker in [teeracle mode](4.4.3-teeracle-oracle-framework.md#build-teeracle-mode)
4. Customize [ your own exchange rate oracle](4.4.3-teeracle-oracle-framework.md#customize-exchange-rate)
5. Deploy on the [Integritee parachain](4.4.7-integritee-parachain-integration.md) or your own testnet
6. Add the trusted sources to the [Teeracle whitelist](4.4.3-teeracle-oracle-framework.md#add-to-whitelist)
7. Try the tutorial [How to build a USD-DOT Oracle from the Template on your own testnet](4.4.3-teeracle-oracle-framework.md#usd-dot-oracle)

### **Building the worker in teeracle mode** <a href="#build-teeracle-mode" id="build-teeracle-mode"></a>

In order to build the worker in teeracle mode, the corresponding cargo feature `teeracle` needs to be set. In the Makefiles, the environment variable `WORKER_MODE` is used to set the cargo features for the worker mode.

In case you build with `make` directly, do so with:

`WORKER_MODE=teeracle make`

In case you use docker with our `build.Dockerfile`, use `--build-arg WORKER_MODE_ARG=teeracle` to set the corresponding docker `ARG`.

An example of a docker build command (as currently used for GitHub CI):

```
docker build -t integritee-worker --target deployed-worker --build-arg WORKER_MODE_ARG=teeracle -f build.Dockerfile 
```

### **Customizing an Exchange Rate Oracle** <a href="#customize-exchange-rate" id="customize-exchange-rate"></a>

* The core part of the exchange oracle-specific code is in the [ita-exchange-oracle package](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/tree/master/app-libs/exchange-oracle)

* The teeracle is launched at the [start](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/2471cc52cf0377323886a43b0e7c2e9181265a67/service/src/main.rs#L478) of the service.

* The exchange rate value is get and updated within the [enclave](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/2471cc52cf0377323886a43b0e7c2e9181265a67/enclave-runtime/src/teeracle/mod.rs#L86)

#### **Scheduling**
To change the update rate interval, you can change the default [setting value](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/2471cc52cf0377323886a43b0e7c2e9181265a67/core-primitives/settings/src/lib.rs#L116) or use a CLI argument: <code><strong>./integritee-service run --teeracle-interval 5s15m2h1d</strong></code>

#### **Trading pair**<a href="#customize-trading-pair" id="customize-tarding-pair"></a>
The trading pair consists of a crypto- and a fiat currency symbol. Ex: {"TEER", "USD"}. It is set at the start of the oracle service : [teeracle-service](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/2471cc52cf0377323886a43b0e7c2e9181265a67/service/src/teeracle/mod.rs#L57).   

To convert the currency symbols into the unique identifiers according to the source API standards, we use a map:  [Coinmarket Cap](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/2471cc52cf0377323886a43b0e7c2e9181265a67/app-libs/exchange-oracle/src/coin_market_cap.rs#L48) and [CoinGecko](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/2471cc52cf0377323886a43b0e7c2e9181265a67/app-libs/exchange-oracle/src/coin_gecko.rs#L50). 
If your currency is not already listed in our mapping already, you will need to add it. It can be looked up in:
* https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Standards-and-Conventions
* https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation

See [How to build a USD-DOT Oracle from the Template on your own testnet](4.4.3-teeracle-oracle-framework.md#usd-dot-oracle) as example.

#### **API Keys**
Our Teeracle reads the Api-Key from an environment variable.

Coinmarket Cap needs an API-Key, which has to be set in the environment variable [COINMARKETCAP_KEY](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/2471cc52cf0377323886a43b0e7c2e9181265a67/app-libs/exchange-oracle/src/coin_market_cap.rs#L51).

#### **Exchange Rate Oracle Source**
To add a new exchange rate oracle, you need to :
1. Create an oracle with a new source in [ita-exchange-oracle package](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/tree/master/app-libs/exchange-oracle)
* **New source**   
We query the exchange rate value via the REST API of the desired source. We use a TLS RestAPI client and explicitly check that the source's TLS-Root-Certificates are correct. This gives us non-repudiation, i.e, it is guaranteed that the result is indeed from the advertised source.   
The code for our two sources can be found in [Coinmarket Cap](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/master/app-libs/exchange-oracle/src/coin_market_cap.rs) and [CoinGecko](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/master/app-libs/exchange-oracle/src/coin_gecko.rs).   
The new _ExchangeRateSource_ must :
   * implement the [OraclSource trait](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/b52be1d355f04e62be5f61d2d9fd2a0ac2fa38a1/app-libs/exchange-oracle/src/exchange_rate_oracle.rs#L36).
   * provide a valid root certificate and the HTTP request to the right endpoint.
   * define the mapping between the currency symbols and the ID used to identify the exchange rate endpoint.
   * implement the parsing of the JSON response data to get the exchange rate value
     
* **New oracle**  
Define a new type for your oracle in [lib.rs](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/master/app-libs/exchange-oracle/src/lib.rs) and add a create function.

2. Get the exchange rate and create an extrinsic from within the [enclave](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/2471cc52cf0377323886a43b0e7c2e9181265a67/enclave-runtime/src/teeracle/mod.rs#L119)  
In [update_market_data_internal](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/b52be1d355f04e62be5f61d2d9fd2a0ac2fa38a1/enclave-runtime/src/teeracle/mod.rs#L86) add your new oracle.

To remove an existing exchange rate oracle source, you need to:   
remove the oracle from [update_market_data_internal](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/b52be1d355f04e62be5f61d2d9fd2a0ac2fa38a1/enclave-runtime/src/teeracle/mod.rs#L86)

### **Add trusted source to whitelist**<a href="#add-to-whitelist" id="add-to-whitelist"></a>
The [teeracle pallet](https://github.com/integritee-network/pallets/tree/master/teeracle/src) maintains a whitelist of trusted exchange rate oracles. A trusted source can be added to the whitelist by Sudo or over the [Democracy](2.5.4-democracy.md)

Call : `teeracle, addToWhitelist ( dataSource , 0x mrenclave_hex)`

The dataSource is the base URL of the source:  https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/ or https://api.coingecko.com/. Warning: no spaces and / at the end.   
The mrenclave hex is written to the logs, when the teeracle service starts.

### **How to build a USD-DOT Oracle from the Template on your own testnet**<a href="#usd-dot-oracle" id="usd-dot-oracle"></a>
1. Fork the worker repository `https://github.com/integritee-network/worker.git` from the SDK release branch (TODO release)
3. Customize the [trading pair](4.4.3-teeracle-oracle-framework.md#customize-tarding-pair):
   * Replace "TEER" with "DOT" in [file](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/2471cc52cf0377323886a43b0e7c2e9181265a67/service/src/teeracle/mod.rs#L57)
   * The DOT currency is listed in the:  [Coinmarket Cap](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/2471cc52cf0377323886a43b0e7c2e9181265a67/app-libs/exchange-oracle/src/coin_market_cap.rs#L48) and [CoinGecko](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/blob/2471cc52cf0377323886a43b0e7c2e9181265a67/app-libs/exchange-oracle/src/coin_gecko.rs#L50) maps.
    
4. Build the worker in [teeracle mode](4.4.3-teeracle-oracle-framework.md#build-teeracle-mode)
5. Run an Integritee solo node in dev mode. The node [runtime](https://github.com/integritee-network/integritee-node/blob/268a0d22dc598ae82515e57406c8044ddda5219f/runtime/src/lib.rs#L646) has the [teeracle pallet](https://github.com/integritee-network/pallets/tree/master/teeracle/src)
6. Coinmarket Cap needs an API-Key. Get it from `https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Introduction` and set it as environment variable:
   ```
   COINMARKETCAP_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxx"
   export COINMARKETCAP_KEY` 
   ```
7. Run the teeracle service in dev mode with a smaller update rate interval 24s
   ```
   cd bin
   ./integritee-service --clean-reset run --node-url <yournodeip> --node-port <port> --dev  --teeracle-interval 24s
   ```
8. Add Coingecko and Coinmarket_CAP to [whitelist with a SUDO](4.4.3-teeracle-oracle-framework.md#add-to-whitelist).
9. Check the events in https://polkadot.js.org : `teeracle.ExchangeRateUpdated`.\
   You should get every 24s an event for https://api.coingecko.com/ and an event for https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/ with the USD/DOT exchange rate value
