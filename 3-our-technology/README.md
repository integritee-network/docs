# 3 Our Technology

Integritee offers a wide range of products and services based on blockchain technology. These are suitable for developers, but also companies who are looking to keep their data confidential while it’s being processed. Our list includes a software development kit, for trusted off-chain workers, L2 sidechains and oracles, and a decentralized attestation service for TEEs. All these are TEE-based, so security and confidentiality are natively considered. Take a deeper dive into our products and services.\


**Software Development Kit**

We make developers' life easier who wish to build sidechains or trusted of chain workers on our network by providing them with our own Software Development Kit (SDK) **** and hide most of the complexity of dealing with TEEs.

**Attesteer**

As the name suggests, the Attesteer is an attestation service designed to authenticate the validity of Trusted Execution Environments in a decentralized and permissionless way.

**TEEracle**

Our TEEracle bridges the gap between web2 and Web3 and is a trusted oracle framework that makes Web2 data available to all projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, fostering interoperability. TEEracle is a solution that provides API data to any Substrate-based blockchain in a secure and efficient way.
