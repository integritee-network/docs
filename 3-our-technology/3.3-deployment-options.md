# 3.3 Deployment Options

Integritee offers a range of possible deployment options. From single company services to consortial setups to entirely unpermissioned operation.

### Unpermissioned operation

Even if we trust the TEE manufacturer’s ability and integrity, a decentralized application (dApp) should be operated by an unpermissioned set of infrastructure providers. Anyone who owns suitable TEE hardware should be able to support the dApp. Integritee allows you to establish unpermissioned operation of your off-chain workers or sidechain validators, while still ensuring integrity and confidentiality through remote attestation.

### Permissioned operation

You may choose to operate all TEE hardware yourself or rent it with an SLA in a jurisdiction of your choice. It is up to you to define who may validate on your sidechain or run your off-chain workers. In any case, the Integritee parachain provides a remote attestation registry for public auditability of your services.
