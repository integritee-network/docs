# 3.4 Scalable Secure Kubernetes Cluster for TEEs

Deployment of use cases built with Integritee’s SDK require server infrastructure that supports TEE technology. Via Securitee ([Home - Securitee](https://securitee.tech/)), our subsidiary, we offer infrastructure with a pre-installed scalable secure Kubernetes cluster for TEEs. It enables customers to deploy sidechain validator nodes and off-chain workers seamlessly and to scale up server capacities at any time if needed. It works in the same way as the open-source Kubernetes software, which takes care of container orchestration, management and scaling - just for TEE-based applications. In short, it is a great shortcut for deployment of any use case built with Integritee’s SDK, as you do not have to worry about infrastructure and configuration. \
