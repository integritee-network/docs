# 6.4 Bug Bounty Program

**The Integritee Bug Bounty Program**

By outsourcing hackers to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities, enhance trust and credibility, and engage the global security community, we can ensure the Integritee platform remains robust and secure. This commitment to security not only protects Integritee's assets and reputation but also builds confidence among its users and partners, ultimately contributing to the project's long-term success and sustainability.

**How it works**

We will post our bounty bug program on Immunefi, one of the largest Bug Bounty Platforms for web3 projects. You will be able to earn up to 10,000 USD in TEER tokens.

We’ve established four levels of vulnerability severity (low, medium, high, and critical) for the Blockchain/DLT category, and participants will be rewarded with USD 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 depending on the kind of issue detected. Note that Proof of Concept is required for any of the tasks mentioned above, and must comply with [Immunefi’s guidelines](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules).

If you’re interested in participating in the program, don’t hesitate to check them out on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/integriteenetwork/) .
